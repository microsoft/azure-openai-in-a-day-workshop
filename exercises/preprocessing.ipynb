    "# Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is an essential step in the process of preparing data for further processing and serving into a large language model. Without data cleaning, the language model would be limited in its ability to interpret and process the data accurately. Data cleaning helps to ensure that the data is in a consistent format, free of any inconsistencies or errors that could lead to incorrect results. It also helps to reduce the amount of time needed to process the data, as it eliminates the need to manually check for any inconsistencies or errors. Additionally, data cleaning can help to improve the accuracy of the language model by removing any irrelevant or incorrect data. By taking the time to properly clean the data, the language model can more accurately interpret and process the data, leading to better results.\n",

    "> *You do not need to manually tokenize strings before feeding texts into the model. This will be done automatically once you put instructions into the `prompt` parameter. However, you can use the `tiktoken` library to check how a string is tokenized and count the numbers of tokens to calculate the cost of an API call. Learn more [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/tokens).*\n",

    "Tokenizing text strings is an important step in natural language processing (NLP) as it helps models like GPT-3 understand the structure of a text string. Tokenizing breaks a text string into smaller pieces called tokens, which can then be analyzed and used by the model. By understanding the structure of a text string, models can better understand the meaning of the text. Additionally, tokenizing helps to determine the cost of an Azure OpenAI Service API call, as usage is priced by token. Furthermore, different models use different encodings, so it is important to tokenize text strings in the appropriate format.\n",

    "Tokens in English typically range from one character to one word (e.g. \"t\" or \"great\"), though some languages may have tokens that are shorter or longer than one character or word. Spaces are usually placed at the beginning of words (e.g. \" is\" instead of \"is \" or \"+\"is\"). You can use the Tokenizer to quickly check how a string is tokenized."

Again, tokenization is not required for the model to work, but it is a good practice to do so to ensure that the data is in a consistent format and that the model is able to process the data correctly. Also, it makes sure that the request is not too long for the model as the maximum number of tokens for davinci is 2048, e.g., equivalent to around 2-3 pages of text.\n",
